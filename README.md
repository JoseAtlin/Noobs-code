# Python_Mini_Projects
A variety of algorithms to solve simple puzzles like tic tac toe, sudoku, hangman.The algorithms are based on Python. Socket programming (Server - Client) basic - sending messages from clients and storing in the Server.Messaging Sockets - Messaging between clients (broadcast, personal). 

## About
The Python files associated are created as a project model which gives a lot of experience of python syntaxes, libraries like NumPy and Random.

This has been the first project that I have been into. The algorithms might not be the best for the scenario, still i worked on to make it better.

**Tic Tac Toe** : Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

Here I,ve used a  random module for the computer moves in the easy_mode, and the algorithm for hard_mode is quite challenging.

**Sudoku Solver** : is a logic-based, combinatoria number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

NumPy module helped in converting the initial array into a 9 x 9 matrix. Also the input has to be read from a file, which is provided as an example in the same.Provides an insight of “file”.

Note : Sudoku w/ backtrack solves all the puzzles while the other one is based on easy and medium type puzzles

**Hangman Game** : It is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

Using Random to choose a word from a file of words. The algorithm asks you how to proceed in the game, simple steps.

**simple_server_client** : It is a basic socket programming using threads to send and recieve messages to the server. Used socket module and threading to create multiple theads / clients.

**Messaging_sockets** : Socket Programming to send and retrieve messages from clients and server. #multithreading #python
